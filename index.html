            Violent crime in the United States is an issue that affects all individuals at some point. Many violent crimes have lasting, rippling effects that affect those other than the victim. The definition of violent crime is a crime that involves the threat or use of force. The UCR is a database created by the FBI to allow law enforcement organizations to report their crime data to a national database so the public can stay informed. By analyzing this data, legislators and the public can come together to see what policies are working and which are not to help decrease crime rates nationwide.
